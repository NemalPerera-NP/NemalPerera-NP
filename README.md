## 🚀 Vision

I design and deliver AI-powered products that move beyond prototypes into reliable, production-ready systems.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Machine Learning Engineering  
- LLM & Agent Systems  
- Product Development  
- Technical Leadership  
- Knowledge Sharing  

I believe great AI is not just built — it is **engineered, guided, and sustained**.

## 🧠 What Makes Me Different

> I combine system-level thinking, product execution, people leadership, and technical teaching — bridging engineering, management, and education.

I don’t just write models.  
I build teams, processes, and platforms that last.
